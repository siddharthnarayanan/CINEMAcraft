Cinemacraft allows users to stage real time plays and produce machinima with Minecraft. The project aims to merge live interactive machinima with Minecraft. The Minecraft mod is targeted towards Minecraft machinima enthusiasts who can use it to create, stage, and produce stories in real-time. The characters show emotion through facial expressions and full body motion which can be captured through multiple camera angles and views, subtitles, scene cues, and more. The project was showcased at SXSW 2016 and was exhibited at the Roanoke Science Museum. The most recent version of Cinemacraft has been set up in the Observation room in the Moss Arts Center at Virginia Tech. A virtual version of the entire building has been designed within Minecraft so that users can connect to the server and see their virtual “mirror” self within the game
