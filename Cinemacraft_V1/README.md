This research explores the varying levels of interaction fidelity by investigating how different levels of responsiveness and behavioural realism affect people’s experience of interacting with virtual humans. This is accomplished through the creation of Cinemacraft, a technology-mediated immersive platform for collaborative human-computer interaction in a virtual 3d world and the incorporation of sensory fusion to improve the fidelity of the real time collaboration. It investigates  interaction techniques within the context of a multiplayer sandbox-voxel game engine and proposes how interaction qualities of the shared virtual 3d space  can be used to further involve a user as well as simultaneously offer a stimulating experience. The primary hypothesis of the study is that embodied interactions result in a higher degree of immersion and co-presence, and that sensory fusion can improve the quality of these interactions. The argument is developed through research justification, followed by a user-study to demonstrate the qualitative results and quantitative metrics.

Cinemacraft allows users to stage real time plays and produce machinima with Minecraft. The project aims to merge live interactive machinima with Minecraft. The Minecraft mod is targeted towards Minecraft machinima enthusiasts who can use it to create, stage, and produce stories in real-time. The characters show emotion through facial expressions and full body motion which can be captured through multiple camera angles and views, subtitles, scene cues, and more. The project was showcased at SXSW 2016 and was exhibited at the Roanoke Science Museum. The most recent version of Cinemacraft has been set up in the Observation room in the Moss Arts Center at Virginia Tech. A virtual version of the entire building has been designed within Minecraft so that users can connect to the server and see their virtual “mirror” self within the game
